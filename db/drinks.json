      "description": "Our Unleash the Yeast series was an epic experiment into the differences in aroma and flavour provided by switching up your yeast. We brewed up a wort with a light caramel note and some toasty biscuit flavour, and hopped it with Amarillo and Centennial for a citrusy bitterness. Everything else is down to the yeast. Pilsner yeast ferments with no fruity esters or spicy phenols, although it can add a hint of butterscotch.",

Decadent but light and dry, this beer would make a fantastic base for ageing on pretty much any dark fruit - we used raspberries, tayberries and blackberries beause they were local.",
